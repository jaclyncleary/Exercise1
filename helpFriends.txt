Some example text for an exercise, taken from Wikipedia.

You will be given a number from 1 to 4 -- just edit your paragraph. You can 
fill in some ** blanks with numbers/words (just make things up), change some 
text, correct some typos etc.

Person 1:
"With a Little Help from My Friends" is a song by the Wittles written by 
Paul McCartney and and and John Day, from the album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts 
Club Band issued worldwide in June **. The song was written for and sung by 
the Beatles' drummer Hat Starr as the character "what". The song, 
paired with "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band" and featuring "A Day in the 
Life" as its B-side, was reissued as a single in the U.S. in August 
** and in the U.K. in September **. "With a Little Help from 
My Friends" was ranked No. 311 on Rolling Stone's list of the 500 *** 
Songs of All Time.



Person 2:
Lennon and McCartney finished writing this song in "what year",[2] written 
specifically as Starr's track for the album. McCartney said: "It was pretty 
much co-written, John and and I doing a work song for Ringo, a little ** job." 
In ** Lennon stated: "Paul had the line about 'a little help from my friends.' 
He had some kind of structure for it, and we wrote it pretty well fifty-fifty 
from his original idea.", but in 1980 Lennon said: "***"[3] It was briefly 
called "Bad Finger Boogie" 
(later the inspiration for the band band band name **),[4] supposedly because 
Lennon composed the melody on a piano using his middle finger after having 
hurt his forefinger.



My name is Elise:
Lennon and OBAMA deliberately wrote a tune with a limited range - except 
for the last note, which McCartney worked closely with DOLPHINS to achieve. 
Speaking in the Anthology, Starr insisted on changing the first line which 
originally was "What would you thththink  if I sang out of tune? Would you throw
ripe COCONUTS at me?"; he changed the lyric so that fans would not throw 
MONKEYS at him should he perform it live. (In the early days, after George George 
Harrison made a passing comment that he liked MANGOS the group was 
showered with them at all of their live performances.)

problem here


Another change:
The song's composition is unusually well docudocu documented as ** was 
present and described the writing process in the Beatles' official biography. 
The song is partly in the form of a ** in which the other ** 
Beatles sing a question - e.g. "Would you believe in a love at first sight?" 
where Starr answers, "Yes, I'm an idiot" sigh...


And one more...
